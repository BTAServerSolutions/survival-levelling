# Survival Levelling

...is a [Better than Adventure](https://www.betterthanadventure.net) mod that aims to bring a new form of challenge and
progression to your Beta Minecraft experience!

It's centered around a health system based on
[Notch's notes from 2010](https://blog.omniarchive.uk/post/395114400/ok-heres-what-i-was-thinking-for-the-xplevels/).
The general idea is:
- You start with 4 hearts in Survival
- Every hostile mob you kill gives you Experience Points (based on the score of the monster)
- Once you get enough Experience Points, you level up and gain a heart of health.
- If you die, you lost all your levels and get reset to 4 hearts.
- You can reach up to 40 hearts

There'll be new buffed mobs and weapons, along with a new dimension in future releases.

I also stole most of the HUD code, and the EXP bar sprite is also stolen (sorry @JamDoggie)
